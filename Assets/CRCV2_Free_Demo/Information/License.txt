LICENSE

Can I use your asset for commercial purposes? What is the license?
Yes, you may use the asset for commercial purposes. Your purchase grants a lifetime license that is valid for every future release of the asset.
This is all governed by the Unity Asset Store End User License Agreement (EULA), the essence of which is:

   - You may use the asset in a game or other type of interactive media, for commercial or other purposes.
   - It is forbidden to resell the asset separately. Also, you may not lend it or license it to anyone else.
   - The asset must be included (packed) in your game in such a way that your own end users would have a reasonably hard time extracting its data. 

NOTE: If you have any further questions regarding the EULA please contact Asset Store Support - assetstore@unity3d.com
